# Cyclops_Extruder

The D3vil Designs "Cyclops" extruder was specifically engineered to address issues
associated with the stock Creality K1 / K1 Max extruder. Not only is the Cyclops a seamless
direct drop-in upgrade, but it also draws on proven technology from the Orbiter 2 project.
This integration enables the Cyclops to inherit superior functionality and performance
improvements, including but not limited to:
● Retraction speeds up to 120 mm/s
● Acceleration up to 3000 mm/s^2
● A powerful LDO Motor
● Large precise drive wheels for increased filament grip
● Improved and direct filament path to meet your needs (PLA, PETG, ASA, ABS, TPU, etc.)
This document serves as a reference guide. For optimal results, users must exercise care
and attentiveness during the assembly and installation processes. Neglecting to adhere
to the provided instructions may lead to suboptimal performance.
Note: This extruder requires root access to your printer.cfg in klipper.
